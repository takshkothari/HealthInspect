Warts and Molluscum

Warts and molluscum are two common skin conditions caused by viral infections. While they can occur anywhere on the body, warts and molluscum are most often found on the hands, feet, and genital areas.

Symptoms of warts may include:
- Small, raised bumps on the skin
- Rough or grainy texture on the surface of the bump
- Pain or tenderness with pressure

Symptoms of molluscum may include:
- Small, raised bumps on the skin
- Pearly or flesh-colored appearance
- Central depression or dimpling on the surface of the bump
- Itching or irritation

The viruses that cause warts and molluscum are highly contagious and can be spread through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated objects or surfaces.

Diagnosis of warts and molluscum typically involves a physical exam, with the characteristic appearance of the bumps being a key factor in diagnosis.

Treatment for warts and molluscum depends on the size, location, and number of bumps, as well as the age and health of the patient. Options may include topical medications, freezing or burning the bumps, or surgical removal.

Prevention of warts and molluscum involves avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects or surfaces. Good hand hygiene and avoiding sharing personal items, such as towels and razors, can also help reduce the risk of infection.

It is important to seek prompt medical attention for suspected warts or molluscum to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Left untreated, these conditions can spread and cause further discomfort or complications.
