Seborrheic Keratoses

Seborrheic Keratoses are a type of non-cancerous skin growth that appears as a waxy, raised, and pigmented lesion on the surface of the skin. They are common in people over the age of 50, and their cause is unknown. They are usually harmless and do not require treatment unless they are causing irritation or affecting a person's appearance.

Symptoms of Seborrheic Keratoses may include:
- Waxy, raised growths on the skin that are usually brown, black, or light tan in color
- May be flat or slightly raised, and have a scaly or rough texture
- They can vary in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters

Seborrheic Keratoses can be diagnosed through a physical examination by a dermatologist. In rare cases, a biopsy may be taken to rule out other skin conditions.

Treatment for Seborrheic Keratoses may not be necessary unless they are causing symptoms, such as itching or irritation, or if they are causing cosmetic concerns. If treatment is needed, it can be done with cryotherapy, which involves freezing the growths with liquid nitrogen, or electrocautery, which uses an electric current to burn off the growths. Laser therapy is another option for treatment.

It is important to have any new or changing skin growths examined by a dermatologist to rule out the possibility of skin cancer.
