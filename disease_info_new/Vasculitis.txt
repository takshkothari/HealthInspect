Vasculitis

Vasculitis is a group of rare diseases that cause inflammation of blood vessels, resulting in damage to tissues and organs throughout the body. There are many types of vasculitis, each affecting different types of blood vessels and causing a range of symptoms.

Symptoms of vasculitis may include:
- Fever
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Skin rashes or lesions
- Joint pain or swelling
- Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet
- Abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms
- Shortness of breath or coughing
- Headaches or vision changes

The exact causes of vasculitis are not fully understood, but they may be related to genetic factors, infections, or autoimmune disorders. Some types of vasculitis are associated with specific triggers, such as exposure to certain drugs or environmental toxins.

Diagnosis of vasculitis typically involves a physical exam, blood tests, and imaging tests, such as CT scan or MRI. A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for vasculitis depends on the type and severity of the disease, as well as the organs and tissues affected. Options may include corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications to reduce inflammation and prevent organ damage. In more severe cases, hospitalization and intensive care may be necessary.

Prevention of vasculitis involves maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding known triggers, such as exposure to certain drugs or environmental toxins.

It is important to seek prompt medical attention for suspected vasculitis to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment, as the condition can be life-threatening if left untreated.
