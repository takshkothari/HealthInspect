Urticaria (Hives)

Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of itchy, raised welts or bumps on the skin. These welts can be red, pink, or flesh-colored, and can vary in size and shape. Urticaria is usually caused by an allergic reaction, but can also be triggered by other factors.

Symptoms of urticaria include:
- Itchy, raised welts on the skin
- Swelling of the affected area
- Redness or discoloration of the skin
- Burning or stinging sensation
- Blister-like bumps

Urticaria can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies to food, medications, or insect bites, as well as exposure to environmental irritants such as pollen or pet dander. In some cases, urticaria may be triggered by underlying medical conditions such as autoimmune disorders or infections.

Diagnosis of urticaria typically involves a physical exam and review of medical history. Blood tests or skin tests may also be ordered to identify potential triggers or underlying conditions.

Treatment for urticaria may involve antihistamines to relieve itching and reduce inflammation, as well as corticosteroids for more severe cases. In addition, it is important to identify and avoid triggers that may be causing the hives, such as certain foods or medications.

Prevention of urticaria involves avoiding known triggers and practicing good hygiene, such as keeping the skin clean and dry.

It is important to seek prompt medical attention for suspected urticaria to prevent the condition from becoming more severe or spreading to other areas of the body.
