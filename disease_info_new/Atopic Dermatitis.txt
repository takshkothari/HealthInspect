Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic Dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is a chronic skin condition that causes inflammation and itching. It typically appears as dry, scaly patches on the skin and can affect any part of the body, but is most commonly found on the face, neck, hands, and feet. AD is more common in children but can affect people of any age.

Symptoms of AD include:
- Dry, scaly patches on the skin
- Redness and inflammation
- Itching, which can be severe
- Crusting and oozing of the affected area
- Thickening of the skin (lichenification) due to constant scratching

The exact cause of AD is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an overactive immune response and a compromised skin barrier function. AD often runs in families and is more common in people with a history of allergies or asthma.

Treatment options for AD include:
- Topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and itching
- Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, which can reduce inflammation without the side effects of corticosteroids
- Moisturizers to keep the skin hydrated and reduce dryness
- Oral antihistamines to reduce itching
- Phototherapy (light therapy) to reduce inflammation
- Systemic medications, such as cyclosporine and methotrexate, for severe cases that do not respond to other treatments

In addition to medical treatment, it is important to identify and avoid triggers that can worsen AD symptoms, such as stress, certain foods, and environmental factors. Daily skin care practices, such as bathing with mild soap and using fragrance-free products, can also help manage AD symptoms and prevent flare-ups.
